Implementation language: C/C++
Hardware info: I am using the linux virtual machine located in the ews lab using a remote connection. The virtual machine provides lag and the remote connection essentially doubles it. I am not familiar with the hardware capabilities. Could not find any info online either. (Same circumstance as MP2).
